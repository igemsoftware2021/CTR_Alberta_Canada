  <h1> How we chose our facilities</h1>
  <p>  Criteria that we used to decide what sustainable restaurant and hotel options that we used encompasses if they are or are attempting to reduce the emissions within their facilities, attempt to persuade customers into turning towards more sustainable events, and are sponsored by environmentally conscious businesses. Criteria that we also used to determine was if the hotel or restaurant has a strong recycling program and a strong composting program. Also included within our criteria is if the restaurant has a strong waste management and reduction program, and is actively working to reduce the amount of waste produced. Our criteria covers whether the hotel and restaurant is converting towards methods that reduce energy and is open about how their energy is being used and where it is being allocated towards.
